## Install from source ##

Make sure you have at least [Go](https://golang.org/) 1.5 installed.
Make sure your `GOPATH` is set, then:

    go get -u -v github.com/ncw/rclone

and this will build the binary in `$GOPATH/bin`.  If you have built
rclone before then you will want to update its dependencies first with
this

    go get -u -v ...

## Installation with Ansible ##

This can be done with [Stefan Weichinger's ansible
role](https://github.com/stefangweichinger/ansible-rclone).

Instructions

  1. `git clone https://github.com/stefangweichinger/ansible-rclone.git` into your local roles-directory
  2. add the role to the hosts you want rclone installed to:
    
```
    - hosts: rclone-hosts
      roles:
          - rclone
```
